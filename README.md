## SherLoc2
### Bioinformatics tool for predicting protein subcellular localizations

This repository mainly provides a containerized installation of SherLoc2 as a webservice.
Just build the image and start the container using the script [start_container.sh](start_container.sh).
Have a look into that script to learn how everything works and to make some changes.
